Switch to high speed continuing beating while adding the sugar one tablespoon at a time. Continue beating until the mixture is stiff and shiny. Ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved and that the mixture does not feel grainy. Beat in the vanilla. Remove the beaters and sprinkle the mixture with vinegar and cornflour, then gently fold in. 2. Spoon the pavolva into the centre of the circle drawn on the baking paper. Using the back of a spoon spread to the edges. Build up the edges slightly so that they are higher than the centre, which will make decorating your pavlova a lot easier. 3. Bake for 75 minutes in the preheated oven. Then turn off the oven, prop the door slightly open and leave the pavlova to cool completely in the oven.4. Decorating: In a clean stainless steel or glass bowl (chill the bowl in the fridge first for better whipping), beat the cream to soft peaks. Add the sugar and beat a little longer. Spoon the whipped cream on top of the pavlova and spread to the edges. 5. You can use almost any combination of fresh fruits to top your pavlova. For an especially stunning presentation, try fresh berries and sugared rose petals. Place the fresh berries in the centre of the pavlova on top of the whipped cream, then arrange the sugared rose petals around the edges.
